In this project, Monte-Carlo simulation is applied to evaluate the nested expectation representing the expected loss of a short position on a put option with a specified maturity. The project starts by establishing a benchmark value using numerical evaluation of a 1D integral with a deterministic quadrature formula. The Black-Scholes price at a given time for a put option is computed, and the nested expectation is evaluated through numerical integration. Additionally, we use of a deep neural network to approximate the inner conditional expectation for the same price, comparing its efficiency with the Nested Monte Carlo method. The process involves generating data and utilizing a deep neural network for estimation, opening avenues for comparison and evaluation of computational efficiency.
